I believe that software development is like creating a piece of art. We the developers are like artist or musicians. With every line of code is like when Beethoven compose “Ode To Joy”, or when Michelangelo painted the “Sistine Chapel”. We bring to our dreams when we put every line of code. For that reason, I love and support open source. Open source Is another way that a collective group of artists work in creating a masterpiece
